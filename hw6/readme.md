- Explain in your own words how you understand the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
- 
- In traditional Synchronous programming, each task is executed one after the other, which can lead to delays in the application. On the other hand, Asynchronous programming,  enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks, improving performance.JavaScript achieves asynchronous programming through various mechanisms, such as Callbacks, Promises, and async/await.
